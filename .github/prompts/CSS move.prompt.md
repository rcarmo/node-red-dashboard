 We need to continue moving all the non-dynamic styling off Preact and create a standard CSS file to ease maintainabiliyt. Perform another complete audit of the entire styling across all components and fix any deviations. Start with the numeric widget, review everything and build a comprehensive todo_list for implementation. Do not forget to remove unused style intializations from components, I see a lot of style.textContent code still around.
